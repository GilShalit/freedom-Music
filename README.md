# Freedom S - Music: An Omeka S Theme

This is an Omeka S theme that is based on the Freedom S theme (v 1.07) and tailored for the [Music, Muslims and Jews site]https://music-muslims-jews.dh.huji.ac.il/s/MMJ-en/page/home.
[Freedom Theme](https://github.com/omeka-s-themes/freedom/blob/master/theme.jpg?raw=true)

Apart from some customizations for the Music, Muslims and Jews site, this theme mostly adds strong multi language support to the original Freedom S theme, including supporting rtl as well as ltr sites.

## Usage
* It is recommended to use this theme with the [Internationalisation](https://github.com/Daniel-KM/Omeka-S-module-Internationalisation) module to provide multi language support for site content.
* To get the item set links on the home page, use the custom [ItemSetLinks](https://github.com/GilShalit/ItemSetLinks-Music) moduleand add the "Item Set Links" block to the home page.
* The assets/css/CSSEditor.css file should be used with the [CSSEditor](https://github.com/omeka-s-modules/CSSEditor) module. It is not linked in the theme.
